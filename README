- viewer, simple html image viewer
    A little gallery viewer for my http server. Shows images from a XHR
    reachable path that's determined by URL's anchor â€” "#/path".

    It's handy for slideshowing if http server has directory listings enabled
    ... and if you're into free software.

    Uses fancybox, boilerplate of index.html taken from fancybox's demo.

- howto
    copy it on your http root as directory viewer
    put some pretty pictures in http://localhost/pictures
    open http://localhost/viewer#/pictures

    Take a look at the code, it's simple and neat.
