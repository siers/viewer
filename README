- viewer, simple html image viewer
    A little gallery viewer for my http server. It takes an argument that is expected
    to be a js-reachable path passed through appending "#/path/to/there" to the URL.

    It's very handy for slideshowing if the http server has directory listings enabled.

    Uses fancybox, boilerplate of index.html taken from fancybox's demo.

- howto
    copy it on your http root as directory viewer
    put some pretty pictures in http://localhost/pictures
    open http://localhost/viewer#/pictures

- also
    Take a look at the code, it's simple and neat.
